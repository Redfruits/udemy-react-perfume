Building Single-Page-Applications (SPAs)

-> When we clicked on page, it looks to the user as if we switched the page, but actually don't request a new HTML file from some server, instead, we just use the JavaScript through React to change what's visible on the screen.

-> That often leads to a smoother UI and a better user experience.
