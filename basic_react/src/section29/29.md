#### What is React.js?

-> It's about client-side JavaScript.
-> All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web

### 460

#### Why React?

-> React makes building complex user interfaces way easier.
-> It does so by giving us a higher level syntax where we write code in a declarative way in a declarative component focused way.

### 461

#### Building Single-Page-Applications (SPAs)

-> When we clicked on page, it looks to the user as if we switched the page, but actually don't request a new HTML file from some server, instead, we just use the JavaScript through React to change what's visible on the screen.

-> That often leads to a smoother UI and a better user experience.

### 466

#### How React works?

-> index. js file will be the starting point of React App.
-> JSX : HTML code in JavaScript. JSX is a special syntax which is not understood by the browser.

### 467

JSX looks like standard HTML, but actually it's JavaScript. Then, if you want assign a CSS class, Use className(instead of class).

#### Building & Re-Using Another component

React embraces this concept of components of building our own building blocks, which we then compose together.

-> When building & Re-using another component, there is one important restriction.

"The name of the function should start with a capital character."

React wants custom components to start with a capital character.

-> If we defined a component once, we possibly reuse it multiple times.
